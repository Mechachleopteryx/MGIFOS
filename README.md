== etymology ==
The famous line "My God, it's full of stars!" were Dave Bowman's final words as he entered the monolith in the book version of 2001: A SpaceOdyssey, in Chapter 39. That line did not occur in the original movie, although it was retrofitted to the various sequels, e.g., in the movie sequel 2010: The Year We Make Contact as being uttered by Dave Bowman as he entered the monolith.
